## JavaScript Functionality Explanation

The JavaScript code in the `index.html` file is responsible for calculating the total time of a list of videos. Here's a detailed explanation of each part:

1. **Selecting Video Time Nodes**:
   ```javascript
   const timeNodes = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('[data-time]'));
   ```
   - This line selects all HTML elements that have a `data-time` attribute (which contains the duration of each video) and converts the NodeList into an array called `timeNodes`.

2. **Mapping Time Codes to Seconds**:
   ```javascript
   const seconds = timeNodes
     .map(node => node.dataset.time)
     .map(timeCode => {
       const [mins, secs] = timeCode.split(':').map(parseFloat);
       return (mins * 60) + secs;
     })
     .reduce((total, vidSeconds) => total + vidSeconds);
   ```
   - The first `map` function extracts the `data-time` values from each node, resulting in an array of time codes (e.g., "5:43").
   - The second `map` function splits each time code into minutes and seconds, converts them to numbers, and calculates the total seconds for each video by multiplying minutes by 60 and adding seconds.
   - Finally, the `reduce` function sums up all the seconds from the videos to get the total duration in seconds.

3. **Calculating Hours, Minutes, and Remaining Seconds**:
   ```javascript
   let secondsLeft = seconds;
   const hours = Math.floor(secondsLeft / 3600);
   secondsLeft = secondsLeft % 3600;

   const mins = Math.floor(secondsLeft / 60);
   secondsLeft = secondsLeft % 60;
   ```
   - This section calculates the total hours, minutes, and remaining seconds from the total seconds.
   - It first calculates the number of hours by dividing the total seconds by 3600 (the number of seconds in an hour) and uses `Math.floor` to round down to the nearest whole number.
   - It then updates `secondsLeft` to the remainder after extracting hours and calculates the number of minutes in a similar way.
   - Finally, it updates `secondsLeft` again to get the remaining seconds.

4. **Logging the Result**:
   ```javascript
   console.log(hours, mins, secondsLeft);
   ```
   - This line outputs the total hours, minutes, and seconds to the console for debugging purposes.

### Summary
The JavaScript code effectively calculates the total duration of all videos listed in the HTML by converting their time codes into seconds, summing them up, and then breaking down the total into hours, minutes, and seconds for easy readability.
