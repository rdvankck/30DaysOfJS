# Day 5: Flex Panel Gallery

> **Note:** The original images have been updated with new ones to enhance the visual appeal and demonstrate the flexibility of the gallery system.

This is the fifth project of my 30 Days of JavaScript challenge, based on Wes Bos's [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) course.

## What I've Built

An interactive gallery of panels with images that expand and show more text when clicked. The gallery uses CSS Flexbox and JavaScript transitions for smooth animations.

## How It Works

- Five panels are displayed side by side with background images
- When a panel is clicked, it expands to take more space using CSS flexbox
- Text elements slide in from top and bottom when a panel is active
- CSS transitions create smooth animations

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with Flexbox)
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)

## Features

- Responsive layout using flexbox
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Interactive panels that respond to user clicks
- Text elements that dynamically appear and disappear

## Key Concepts Learned

- CSS Flexbox for layout
- CSS transitions and transforms
- Event handling in JavaScript
- classList API for adding/removing classes
- JavaScript transitionend events
