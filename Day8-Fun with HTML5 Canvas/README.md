# Day 8: Fun with HTML5 Canvas

## Interactive Drawing with HTML5 Canvas API

This exercise demonstrates how to create an interactive drawing application using the HTML5 Canvas API:

### Canvas Features
- **Dynamic Canvas Sizing**: Canvas automatically fills the browser window
- **Color Changing**: Drawing line color cycles through the HSL color spectrum
- **Line Width Animation**: Line thickness grows and shrinks as you draw
- **Smooth Lines**: Round line caps and joins for a natural drawing feel

### JavaScript Techniques
- **Canvas Context API**: Using the 2D drawing context
- **Mouse Event Handling**: Tracking mouse movements for drawing
- **HSL Color Model**: Using HSL for easy color cycling
- **Destructuring Assignment**: Using modern JS syntax for cleaner code

### Drawing Mechanics
- Drawing only happens when the mouse is pressed down
- Line color changes continuously as you draw
- Line width oscillates between thin and thick
- Drawing stops when mouse is released or leaves the canvas

## How to Use
1. Open index.html in your browser
2. Click and hold the mouse button to start drawing
3. Move the mouse to draw colorful lines
4. Release the mouse button to stop drawing

This project showcases the power of the HTML5 Canvas API for creating interactive graphics and demonstrates how to handle mouse events for drawing applications.
