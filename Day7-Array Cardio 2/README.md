# Day 7: Array Cardio Day 2

This is the seventh project of my 30 Days of JavaScript challenge, based on Wes Bos's [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) course.

## Project Overview

In this project, I continue to strengthen my JavaScript array method skills by working with more advanced array methods. This is a console-based exercise that demonstrates the power and flexibility of JavaScript's built-in array methods.

## Key Features

- Practical examples of advanced array methods
- Console-based demonstrations
- Real-world use cases for array manipulation

## Array Methods Covered

- `Array.prototype.some()` - Checks if at least one element passes a test
- `Array.prototype.every()` - Checks if all elements pass a test
- `Array.prototype.find()` - Returns the first element that passes a test
- `Array.prototype.findIndex()` - Returns the index of the first element that passes a test
- Immutable array updates using spread operator and slice

## What I Learned

- How to use `some()` to check if at least one item in an array meets a condition
- Using `every()` to verify if all items in an array meet a condition
- Finding specific items with `find()` instead of filtering and taking the first result
- Using `findIndex()` to locate the position of an item in an array
- Creating new arrays without mutating the original using spread syntax and `slice()`
- Implementing immutable data patterns in JavaScript

## How to Use

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser
2. Open the browser's JavaScript console (F12 or right-click > Inspect > Console)
3. See the results of the array operations in the console
4. Experiment by modifying the code and observing the results
