# Day 6: Type Ahead

This is the sixth project of my 30 Days of JavaScript challenge, based on Wes Bos's [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) course.

## Project Overview

In this project, I built a search feature that shows real-time suggestions as you type. The application searches through a dataset of cities and states in the USA, displaying matching results with population data.

## Key Features

- Real-time search filtering as you type
- Highlighting of matching search terms
- Display of population data with proper formatting
- Stylish UI with subtle animations
- Fetching data from an external JSON API

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Transforms, Transitions)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Fetch API
- Regular Expressions
- ES6 Features (Arrow Functions, Template Literals, Spread Operator)

## What I Learned

- How to use `fetch()` to get data from an external API
- Working with Promises in JavaScript
- Using Regular Expressions for flexible text matching
- Building filter functionality with Array methods
- Creating highlighted search results
- Formatting numbers with commas using Regex
- Handling keyup events for real-time updates
- Creating a responsive UI with CSS transforms

## How to Use

1. Type any city or state name in the search box
2. See results update in real-time as you type
3. Results show matching cities/states with their populations
4. Search terms are highlighted in yellow
