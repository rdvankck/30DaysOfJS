# Day 1: JavaScript Drum Kit

This is the first project of my 30 Days of JavaScript challenge, based on Wes Bos's [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) course.

## What I've Built

A virtual drum kit that plays sounds when you press the corresponding keys on your keyboard. The buttons animate when pressed, giving visual feedback to the user.

## How It Works

- Press the keys A, S, D, F, G, H, J, K, or L to play different drum sounds
- Each key press triggers a sound and a brief animation
- The project uses pure JavaScript without any libraries or frameworks

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)

## Features

- Keyboard event listeners
- Audio playback
- CSS transitions and animations
- DOM manipulation

## Key Concepts Learned

- Key events in JavaScript
- Playing audio with JavaScript
- CSS transitions
- Working with data attributes
- Event listeners and callback functions
