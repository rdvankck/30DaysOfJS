# Day 3: CSS Variables with JS

This is the third project of my 30 Days of JavaScript challenge, based on Wes Bos's [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) course.

## What I've Built

An interactive image editor that uses CSS variables and JavaScript to update spacing, blur, and color values in real-time as the user adjusts input controls.

## How It Works

- CSS variables (custom properties) are defined in the `:root` pseudo-class
- Range sliders and a color picker control the values of these CSS variables
- JavaScript updates the CSS variables in real-time as users interact with the controls
- The changes are immediately reflected in the styling of the image

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with CSS Variables/Custom Properties)
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)

## Features

- Real-time adjustment of image spacing/padding
- Real-time blur effect adjustment
- Color picker for changing the image's background and highlighted text
- Smooth interaction with range sliders

## Key Concepts Learned

- Using CSS Variables (Custom Properties)
- How to update CSS variables with JavaScript
- Working with range inputs and color pickers
- Dataset attributes in HTML
- Event handling for both change and mousemove events
- The power of CSS variables for creating dynamic interfaces
