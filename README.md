# 30 Days of JavaScript

This is my journey through 30 days of JavaScript coding challenges based on [Wes Bos's JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) course. Each day, I'll be building a new project using vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks, no libraries, no compilers).

## Projects

| Day | Project | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| 1 | [JavaScript Drum Kit](./Day1-Drum%20Kit) | A virtual drum kit that plays sounds when you press keys |
| 2 | [JS and CSS Clock](./Day2-JSClock) | An analog clock built with CSS and JavaScript |
| 3 | [CSS Variables with JS](./Day3-CSS%20Variables) | Image editor with adjustable properties using CSS variables |
| 4 | [Array Cardio Day 1](./Day4%20-%20Array%20Cardio%201) | A simple project to practice array methods in JavaScript |
| 5 | [Flex Panel Gallery](./Day5-Flex%20Panel%20Gallery) | Interactive image panels that expand with animations using Flexbox |
| 6 | [Type Ahead](.Day6-Type%20Ahead) | Search feature that shows real-time suggestions as you type |

## Goals

- Improve my JavaScript skills
- Learn modern ES6+ features
- Build practical projects
- Understand DOM manipulation better
- Get comfortable with event handling
- Practice problem-solving with JavaScript

## How to Use

Each project is contained in its own folder with everything needed to run it. Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the project in action.
